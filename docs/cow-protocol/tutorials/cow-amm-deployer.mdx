# CoW AMM Deployer

[CoW AMM](https://cow.fi/cow-amm) is a production-ready implementation of an FM-AMM that supplies liquidity for trades made on CoW Protocol. Solvers compete with each other for the right to trade against the AMM. The winning solver is the one that moves the AMM curves higher.

[CoW AMM Deployer](https://app.safe.global/share/safe-app?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmonorepo-cow-amm-deployer.vercel.app&chain=eth) is an interface developed by [bleu](https://github.com/bleu-fi) to deploy and manage CoW AMMs from Safe wallets. The project was funded by the [CoW Grants DAO](https://grants.cow.fi/) to help users without programming skills to take advantage of the CoW AMM.

## Access the app

The app is a Safe App, which means it is only accessible from a Safe wallet. It is recommended that the Safe wallet should only be used for this purpose. Additionally, the Safe wallet should have the tokens to provide liquidity to the AMM before creating it. So, the steps to use the app are:

* ðŸ†• [Create a new Safe](https://app.safe.global/welcome) wallet
* ðŸ“¤ Transfer both tokens with the desired amount from your wallet to the recently created Safe wallet.
* ðŸ”Œ With your Safe wallet, open [CoW Swap (Safe App)](https://app.safe.global/share/safe-app?appUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fswap.cow.fi&chain=eth)

## Create your AMM

Once you enter the app, you should see the app homepage that will ask you to go to the `Create AMM` page after showing you a warning about only using the Safe wallet for this purpose. This page is a form to create the AMM. The fields are:

1. Token pair that you want to provide liquidity to the AMM. Both tokens need to already be in your Safe Wallet at this point.
2. Price Oracle to provide price hints to the AMM. Balancer and UniSwap V3 are the options available at the moment. In each one of them, you have to input the pool identifier used by the protocol. Below this field, there is a button if you want to load this information from the protocol subgraph. If this button fails, it means that there isn't a pool with at least $ 1000 USD of TVL for that token pair.
3. The minimum amount of the first token to be involved in each trade. For most tokens, this value should be filled automatically. If not, a good strategy is to calculate how much of the first token represents $10 USD.
4. Same as on the [Twap Order](./cow-swap/twap.mdx), if your wallet is _unsupported_, upgrade to a Safe with the special fallback handler. [Learn all about the new Safe fallback handler](https://blog.cow.fi/all-you-need-to-know-about-cow-swaps-new-safe-fallback-handler-8ef0439925d1) and its relevance to Safe in this [overview](https://help.safe.global/en/articles/40838-what-is-a-fallback-handler-and-how-does-it-relate-to-safe). Naturally, the upgrade process has undergone [extensive auditing](https://github.com/cowprotocol/composable-cow/tree/ab3addad9bc05acdbf5fb040eb5c336209b58e31/audits) for increased peace of mind.

After that, you can click on the `Create AMM` button and sign the transaction on your Safe wallet. Then the App will redirect to a loading page until the transaction is confirmed and then redirect you to the `Manager` page. If the signing process will take some time, you can close the app and check the transaction status on the Safe wallet interface.

## Manage and edit your AMM

Once you have a CoW AMM LP position running, the home page will redirect you to the `Manager` page. This page has useful information about the AMM, such as the total value, the amount of each token, the price oracle, and a link to the swaps made by the CoW AMM on the CoW Explorer.

In that page you can do two actions:

1. Stop the AMM LP position that will redirect you to a page to confirm the action. After that, the AMM will be stopped, and the tokens will remain in the Safe wallet.
2. Edit AMM LP parameters that will redirect you to the same form used to create the AMM. This form will be filled with the current parameters of the AMM, and you can change them as you want.
